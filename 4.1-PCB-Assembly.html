          </h3>

          <p class="para-spacing my-4">
            PCB Assembly is one of the most critical points in the process of
            attaining the features and functionalities you seek from your PCB.
            All the designed features, component innovation, and supply chain
            efficiencies assimilate at the point of assembly. We have installed
            systems throughout the process to maintain the integrity of
            components and test the quality of the PCB in line with your
            requirements.
          </p>
          <p class="para-spacing my-3">
            Our assembly system runs from placement, soldering, insertion,
            clearing, and inspection. We have deployed BOM Component
            Verification for quality control, along with options of
            Surface-Mount or Through-Hole Technology, to meet your assembly
            requirements.

          <h3 class="heading-medium">Range Of Alternatives</h3>
          <p class="para-spacing my-3">
            Turnkey Assembly We work around the entire schedule and process of
            ordering components like active, passive, electrochemical,
            connectors & cables etc. from a wide range of vendors who meet our
            excellence-standards. As soon as these components arrive at our
            facility, they are tested on our parameters, and only the ones that
            sustain the tests are processed through our assembly system. This
            ensures:

          <ul class="list-style">
            <li>
              <strong>100% Quality Assurance:</strong> Each vendor is verified
              by our testing process. In addition to this, each component is
              thoroughly verified before it becomes a part of the assembly
              process.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Zero Delays Caused by Miscommunication:</strong> Our
              precise manufacturing process gives you a cost-effective solution,
              without making you go through the time-consuming process of
              verifying and coordinating with multiple vendors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Industry-Standard Outputs: </strong> All the PCBs
              assembled with the process are high-performing and in-line with
              the industry standards.

          <p class="para-spacing my-3">
            Consigned Assembly You can send us the components you have stored or
            stocked using your own supply-chain capacities. We can run tests
            necessary to ensure quality control. If you have already run quality
            testing, we can quickly take it through assembly and delivery.

              <strong>Short Lead Time:</strong>We leverage the collaborative
              powers of your sourcing prowess and our manufacturing excellence
              to give you a high-quality PCB in a very short period.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Internal Quality Control: </strong>If you are maintaining
              a high quality-standard in component sourcing, you can stay
              assured that the same quality is retained through our
              manufacturing system.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Retained Proprietary Information:</strong>This process is
              also the optimal solution if you have any proprietary components
              designed, developed, or sourced by your team.

            Partially-Consigned Assembly This is an ad hoc arrangement where you
            can supply a partial list of components necessary for the PCB, and
            still take advantage of our supply chain efficiencies as we source
            the rest of the components.

              already have some critical components in store and want to
              go-to-market with your end-product, we can source the other
              standardized components and optimize the process for you.

            <li>
              <strong>Comprehensive Quality Observance: </strong>This brings the
              best of both the worlds – you can run your own quality testing on
              the components you send us, while we ensure high excellence
              standards for all the components we source.
