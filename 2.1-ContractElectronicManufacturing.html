                Through-hole takes a little longer because it involves more

                experience when working with state-of-the-art electronics
                manufacturers. Specializing in harsh environment cables, an

                With a certified quality management system, your contract

                Little surprise then, that even though surface mount components

                For cable assemblies, manufacturing is done with hand soldering
                -- your vendor should be certified in this. Many can also have
                injection over-molding capabilities. This refers to a process in
                which a single part is created using multiple materials.
                Typically the first material (sometimes called the substrate) is
                at least partially covered by subsequent materials (over-molds)
                during manufacturing.

              <p class="para-spacing my-3">
                Does your vendor offer custom over-molding capabilities? It’s

                Time to test? Cables can receive a functional test and a pull
                test. The testing process doesn’t need to be as rigorous as with
                PCB assemblies.

                Forms of these tests include automated cable testing, and
                continuity and “hipot” testing. “Hipot” is short for high
                potential, which in turn means high voltage. A hipot test is the
                opposite of a continuity test in that it makes sure no current
                will flow from one point to another.

                Configuration management is a means of establishing consistency

                shrink is a shrinkable plastic tubing that goes over the cable.

              <h5 class="heading-medium my-3">PROTOTYPING</h5>
              <p class="paara-spacing my-3">
                Messing up an electronic device rollout can be painfully
                expensive. PCB prototyping can help you avoid an embarrassing
                situation when you head to launch.
              </p>
              <p class="paara-spacing my-3">
                Many of the justifications for prototyping are obvious, but not
                all of them:
              </p>

              <ul class="list-style mx-3">
                <li>
                  <strong> Design fault checks:</strong> An expert ECM can
                  easily detect technical and human faults. It can then
                  recommend improvements before you finalize your design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Product durability:</strong>In the real world, your
                  product often has to withstand at least one of the following:
                  temperature variations, power variations, shock resistivity.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Protecting your budget:</strong>Is your product
                  intended for the masses rather than a niche market? A redo is
                  going to be especially costly. Once the final PCB design heads
                  to mass production, there’ no “rewind” button.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Confirmation for production:</strong>Overall product
                  design and packaging depend on the PCB’s design and size.
                  Prototyping will solidify these attributes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Product characteristics inspecting:</strong>Sometimes,
                  the practical values of the product are a shade off the
                  theoretical values considered in the design stage. Prototypes
                  can help you check and update these values.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="para-spacing my-3">
                PCB prototyping services often takes one of these four forms. As
                you go down the list, the build gets more "complete":
              </p>
              <ul class="list-style mx-3">
                <li>Visual model</li>
                <li>Proof of concept</li>
                <li>Working prototype</li>
                <li>Functional prototype</li>
              </ul>

              <h5 class="heading-medium">AFTERMARKET SERVICES</h5>
              <p class="para-spacing my-3">
                Your ECM’s commitment to customer satisfaction must continue
                long after product delivery.
              </p>
              <p class="para-spacing my-3">
                Check for three qualities in an electronics aftermarket services
                provider: experience, expertise and technology. For example,
                Matric Group keeps the customer’s supply chain going with
                product upgrades, calibration, and repair services handled by
                state-of-the-art equipment run by skilled technicians.
              </p>
              <p class="para-spacing my-3">
                Regardless of where your industrial or consumer was made or what
                it was made for, your electronics manufacturing services
                provider should have the know-how to service it properly.

                engineering.
              </p>
              <p class="para-spacing my-3">
                Some service providers can even help you get ahead of the issues
                with <strong>failure analysis</strong>. If the same repair is
                being done repeatedly, a provider may jump in and quote a
                redesign that will save you money in the long run.
              </p>

              <h3 class="heading-medium">OBSOLESCENCE MANAGEMENT</h3>
              <p class="para-spacing my-3">
                Obsolescence is a similar issue in electronics manufacturing.
                When a part is nearing the end of its life, your supplier can
                quote you for new supplies so you’re not caught unprepared.
              </p>
              <p class="para-spacing my-3">
                There are three possible recommendations the provider will
                offer:
              </p>

              <ul class="list-style mx-3">
                <li>
                  End-of-life -- the part is no longer useful and no longer
                  supported
                </li>
                <li>
                  Last time buy -- a final bulk purchase before the maker
                  discontinues the part
                </li>
                <li>
                  Not recommended for new design -- The future of the part is
                  uncertain, outdated, or carries risk of becoming obsolete.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p class="para-spacing my-3">
                To help manage component obsolescence, a vendor should offer
                life-cycle analysis. This assessment looks at the total
                environmental impacts of a component through its entire life.
                Before you even finish production, your vendor can proactively
                look for parts that will need replaced and help you them obtain
                alternatives.
              </p>
              <p class="para-spacing my-3">
                So, despite the term “aftermarket,” some of these services can
                benefit you before customers see your end result. You should
                always be aware of the risks before you send a product to
                market!

                This is just a beginning overview of electronic contract
                manufacturing services. As you can see, what you get varies
                greatly by vendor. Some are simply looking to print bare boards
                in huge volumes. Others offer complex, creative solutions in
                smaller volumes and assist with several steps of the supply
                chain.
